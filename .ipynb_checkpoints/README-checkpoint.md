# ppae

## Successful experiments:
- RNN encoder: hidden size 64, latent size 10, lam_TV = 0.5, lam_latent = 0.1
  Resnet decoder

## Current problem

## TODO list
- Think about adding energy to the simulation
    - Need some pointers of "fake" events
- Think about potentialy other types of smoothness penalties
