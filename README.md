# ppae

## Successful experiments:
- RNN encoder: hidden size 64, latent size 10, lam_TV = 0.5, lam_latent = 0.1
  Resnet decoder

## Current problem

## TODO list
- Pick out outliers from the data
- Think about whether we need "fake" events for our simulation
- Think about potentialy other types of smoothness penalties
